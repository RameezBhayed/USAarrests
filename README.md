Introduction:
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of crime data to explore patterns, relationships, and clusters within the dataset. The objective was to gain insights into the complex interactions between crime rates and urbanization, challenging the common belief that higher urbanization inevitably leads to elevated crime rates.
Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: I began by examining the dataset, which contained information on crime rates (Murder, Assault, Rape) and urban population (UrbanPop) for various U.S. cities. Fortunately, the data was clean, with no missing values or duplicate rows.
Data Validation: I validated the data by checking for issues like leading/trailing whitespaces, inconsistent capitalization, and non-alphanumeric characters (excluding spaces) in city names, all of which were absent.
Data Analysis:

To understand the dataset's characteristics, I computed summary statistics, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for each crime variable.
I used visualizations, such as heatmaps and pair plots, to explore correlations and relationships between crime variables and urban population.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

In an effort to reduce dimensionality while preserving meaningful information, I conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the standardized data.
PCA revealed that crime rates (Murder, Assault, Rape) and urbanization (UrbanPop) played significant roles in explaining data variance.
Interpretation of principal components highlighted the importance of these factors in capturing variations within the dataset.
Hierarchical Clustering:

I employed hierarchical clustering on the standardized data and created a dendrogram to visualize data point relationships.
Using a clustering threshold (k=3), I identified clusters with distinct characteristics, including high crime rates, low crime rates, and moderate crime rates.
The findings challenged the assumption that higher urbanization directly correlates with higher crime rates.
K-Means Clustering:

I applied K-Means clustering to the data and utilized the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Employing the same clustering threshold (k=3) as in hierarchical clustering, I reaffirmed the presence of clusters with similar characteristics.
Conclusion:
In summary, this project provided a detailed exploration of crime data, encompassing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and clustering analysis. The key takeaway was the debunking of the urbanization-crime rate myth, as exemplified by Cluster 3, which had high urbanization and only moderate crime rates. These findings underscored the complexity of factors influencing crime rates and challenged simplistic assumptions.

This analysis not only contributes to a better understanding of crime patterns but also highlights the need to consider multifaceted determinants when studying urbanization's impact on crime rates.
